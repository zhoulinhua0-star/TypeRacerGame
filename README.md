## Projects

### Project 1: Console-Based Edition
**TypeRacerGame.java** - A console-based typing game written in Java. Users type a series of predefined sentences, and the program calculates typing time, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) for each round, with an overall summary at the end.

### Project 2: GUI Precision Edition
**PrecisionTyper.java** - A precision-focused desktop typing application built with Java Swing. Designed for users who want to master both speed and 100% accuracy. Unlike casual typing games, this "Strict Edition" requires a perfect match of the target text before allowing a successful submission. Features include:
- Real-time Light/Dark mode toggle
- Custom-coded mechanical "tock" sound generator
- Persistent theme settings
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Full comprehensive text database

#### 🎯 Why Use PrecisionTyper Web Edition?

Whether you're a student, professional, or casual typist, PrecisionTyper helps you build muscle memory and typing confidence through focused practice. The strict 100% accuracy requirement ensures you develop proper typing habits, not just speed.

#### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open the Application**
   - Visit: **[https://typeracer-game-exg4alf1z-linhua-zhous-projects.vercel.app/](https://typeracer-game-exg4alf1z-linhua-zhous-projects.vercel.app/))**
   - Or open `index.html` locally in your browser
   - No downloads, installations, or account creation required

2. **Choose Your Difficulty Level**
   - **Easy**: Short, simple sentences perfect for beginners
   - **Medium**: Moderate-length passages for intermediate typists
   - **Hard**: Complex, longer texts to challenge advanced users

3. **Start Typing**
   - Type the text shown in the display area
   - The timer starts automatically when you begin
   - Match every character exactly - 100% accuracy is required

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - Watch real-time statistics:
     - **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Your typing speed
     - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct characters
     - **Time**: Elapsed time since you started

5. **Complete the Challenge**
   - Finish typing the entire text with perfect accuracy
   - Review your final statistics
   - Press 'return' or 'enter' key to continue the next typing journey
   - Select a new text to continue practicing

#### 🚀 Technical Highlights

- **Resilient Sourcing**: Implements a Hybrid API + Local Fallback strategy. If the Quotable API fails, the system seamlessly transitions to a local database for zero-downtime training.
- **Smart Randomization**: Employs a Non-Consecutive Algorithm using a do-while collision check. This ensures the current sentence never duplicates the previous one, maximizing variety.
- **Precision Metrics**: Calculates WPM and Accuracy via the High Resolution Time API, using the 5-character standard for professional-grade tracking.
- **Tactile Audio**: Features a Web Audio API Synthesis engine, generating real-time mechanical click sounds without external assets.

#### 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results

- **Start with Easy**: Build confidence with shorter texts before progressing
- **Focus on Accuracy**: Speed comes naturally with proper technique
- **Practice Regularly**: Consistent daily practice yields better results than long sporadic sessions
- **Use Visual Feedback**: Pay attention to the color-coded characters:
  - 🟢 **Green** = Correct
  - 🔴 **Red** = Mistake (fix it!)
  - ⚪ **Grey** = Not yet typed
  - 🟡 **Yellow** = Current position
- **Customize Your Experience**: Toggle sound effects and switch between dark/light themes in the settings

#### 🎨 Features

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant visual and statistical feedback as you type
- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Progress from beginner to advanced at your own pace
- **Theme Support**: Dark and light modes with automatic preference saving
- **Sound Effects**: Optional mechanical click sounds for enhanced focus
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **No Setup Required**: Open and start practicing immediately

#### 📊 Understanding Your Statistics

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Standardized measurement of typing speed (1 word = 5 characters)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Time**: Total time spent typing the current text

Aim for balanced improvement - higher accuracy and consistent speed over time.
