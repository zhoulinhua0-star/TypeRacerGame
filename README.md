# TypeRacerGame
This repository consists of two files regarding a simple type racer game.
The first project is a simple console-based typing game written in Java to practice typing speed and accuracy. Users type a series of predefined sentences, and the program calculates typing time, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) for each round, with an overall summary at the end. 
The second one is a more advanced version marked by generation of the "window" which is also more challenging for users: a precision-focused desktop typing application built with Java Swing. Designed for users who want to master both speed and 100% accuracy. Unlike casual typing games, this "Strict Edition" requires a perfect match of the target text before allowing a successful submission.
