# TypeRacerGame

A collection of typing speed and accuracy trainers with three implementations: console-based, desktop GUI, and modern web application.

## Projects

### Project 1: Console-Based Edition
**TypeRacerGame.java** - A console-based typing game written in Java. Users type a series of predefined sentences, and the program calculates typing time, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) for each round, with an overall summary at the end.

### Project 2: GUI Precision Edition
**PrecisionTyper.java** - A precision-focused desktop typing application built with Java Swing. Designed for users who want to master both speed and 100% accuracy. Unlike casual typing games, this "Strict Edition" requires a perfect match of the target text before allowing a successful submission. Features include:
- Real-time Light/Dark mode toggle
- Custom-coded mechanical "tock" sound generator
- Persistent theme settings
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Full comprehensive text database
