# TypeRacerGame

This repository consists of two files regarding a simple type racer game.

### Project 1: Console-Based Edition
TypeRacerGame.java is a console-based typing game written in Java to practice typing speed and accuracy. Users type a series of predefined sentences, and the program calculates typing time, accuracy, and words per minute (WPM) for each round, with an overall summary at the end. 

### Project 2: GUI Precision Edition
PrecisionTyper.java is a more advanced and (more importantly) cooler version marked by the generation of the "window" which is also more challenging for users: a precision-focused desktop typing application built with Java Swing. Designed for users who want to master both speed and 100% accuracy. Unlike casual typing games, this "Strict Edition" requires a perfect match of the target text before allowing a successful submission. What makes it even cooler is that it features a real-time Light/Dark mode toggle and uses a custom-coded mechanical "tock" generator.
